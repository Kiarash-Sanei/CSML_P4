# Assembly-Optimized Game Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of assembly language optimizations in performance-critical sections of a C++ game implementation. The primary focus is on showcasing how assembly can be used to enhance performance in hot spots of the application.

## Key Features

- Custom assembly implementations for performance-critical functions
- Hybrid C++ and assembly architecture
- Performance comparisons between pure C++ and assembly-optimized versions

## Technical Implementation

### Assembly Integration

- `R.s`, `S.s`, and `C.s` contain optimized assembly routines
- Hot paths identified and reimplemented in assembly for maximum performance
- Direct integration with C++ codebase through proper calling conventions

### Project Structure

- `class.cpp` - Core C++ implementations
- `function.cpp` - Supporting functions
- `game.cpp` - Main game logic
- `kgh.h` - Header definitions
- `S.s`, `R.s`, `C.s` - Assembly optimized routines
- `game.sh` - Build/run script

## Performance Highlights

- Assembly-optimized sections show significant performance improvements in:
  - Critical game calculations
  - Memory operations
  - Time-sensitive computations

## Building and Running

```bash
./game.sh
```
